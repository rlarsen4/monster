The following steps are done by the person wanting to copy text_adventure database onto their server:
1. Copy the file text_adventure.out to the server where you want to install the database into from github.
2. Start the mysql command in a terminal window on the server where you want to copy the database onto.
     mysql -u root

3. create an empty database by the name you want. Donâ€™t try to use an already existing NON EMPTY database. This will create problems beyond the scope of this how-to.
     mysql> create database text_adventure;

4. exit mysql
5. Now restart mysql, specifying the database you want to use, and pass in the text_adventure.out file to populate it:
     mysql -u root text_adventure < text_adventure.out

6. Now that you are in mysql you can do the following to verify the data has been imported.
     use text_adventure;
     show tables;
